# javascript-jquery

This repo contains my Javascript and jQuery project from the [Web Development 101](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101) section of the [Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses).  

You can find full details on the [project page](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/javascript-and-jquery).

You can view the finished project and play with it in your browser [on my website](http://localhost:1313/static/projects/odinProject/javascriptAndjQuery/project.html).

A full write up will likely be completed at a later data detailing how/why I did certain steps. You can find this within the [Odin Project](https://www.josharcher.uk/categories/odin-project/) category on [my website](https://www.josharcher.uk/).
